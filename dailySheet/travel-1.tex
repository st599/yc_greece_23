\noindent Alimos ($ A\lambda\iota\mu o \sigma $) Marina is in the SW of Athens near Piraeus ($ \Pi\epsilon\iota\rho\alpha\iota\alpha\sigma $) Port on the Attica peninsular.\\
The sailing area consists of the Saronic and Argolic Gulfs (between the Attica and Peloponese peninsulars on the mainland) and islands such as Aegina, Poros, Methana, Hydra and Dhokos.  It includes small fishing villages, flooded volcanoes, artist retreats and some ancient sites.  Expect lots of time to look around, go snorkelling or diving, some culinary treats and not many marinas.
